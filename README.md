# Movies App
This movie app allows a user to list, search, and add movies from a given dataset. 

## Prerequisites
- Node (v18 or newer)
- NPM (v9 or newer)

## Setup
- [See Backend README](./MoviesAppBackend/README.md)
- [See Frontend README](./MoviesAppFrontend/README.md)

## Assignment:
    
Design and implement an API service against which the API client can retrieve movies and manage their data:

- Choose a commonly used protocol that the client can use to communicate with the API (such as HTTP or GraphQL)
- Implement the API with Node.js. We recommend using an application framework.
- Implement the user interface with Angular. We recommend using an application framework.
- The data used by the service is attached in the movies-compact.json file.
- Please implement data persistence or storage.
- Use cases for the service:
    - List all movies (you can show relevant information about movies in the listing)
    - Search for movies that match the client's search term
    - Adding a new movie and its information to the database

- Consider that your application might be developed further by some other developer.
- Implement at least 1 unit test for the feature of your choice.
